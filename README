# JS8Call

JS8Call is an experiment in combining the robustness of FT8 (a weak-signal mode by K1JT) with a messaging and network protocol layer for weak signal communication. The open source software is designed for connecting amateur radio operators who are operating under weak signal conditions and offers real-time keyboard-to-keyboard messaging, store-and-forward messaging, and automatic station announcements.

# Notice

JS8Call is a derivative of the WSJT-X application, restructured and redesigned for message passing using a custom FSK modulation called JS8. It is not supported by nor endorsed by the WSJT-X development group. While the WSJT-X group maintains copyright over the original work and code, JS8Call is a derivative work licensed under and in accordance with the terms of the GPLv3 license.

# History

* July 6, 2017 - The initial idea of using a modification to the FT8 protocol to support long-form QSOs was developed by Jordan, KN4CRD, and submitted to the WSJT-X mailing list: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/35931540/
* August 31, 2017 - Jordan, KN4CRD, did a little development and modified WSJT-X to support long-form QSOs using the existing FT8 protocol: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36020051/  He sent a video example to the WSJT-X group: https://widefido.wistia.com/medias/7bb1uq62ga
* January 8, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, started working on the design of a long-form QSO application built on top of FT8 with a redesigned interface.
* February 9, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, submitted question to the WSJT-X group to see if there was any interest in pursuing the idea: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36221549/
* February 10, 2018 - Jordan KN4CRD, Julian OH8STN, John N0JDS, and the Portable Digital QRP group did an experiment using FSQ. The idea of JS8Call, combining FT8, long-form QSOs, and FSQCall like features was born.
* February 11, 2018 - Jordan, KN4CRD, inquired about the idea of integrating long-form messages into WSJT-X: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36223372/
* February 12, 2018 - Joe Taylor, K1JT, wrote back: https://sourceforge.net/p/wsjt/mailman/message/36224507/ saying that “Please don't let my comment discourage you from proceeding as you wish, toward something new.”
